# Got locked out of 2410 instance last night trying to setup ssh fry and had to create new instance to finish dotfiles assignment.
# Deleted the previous key from authorized_keys.
# Cannot log on to fry from home using an EC2 instance, even when connected to WSU VPN.
# Will reattempt when back on campus Friday and connected to WSU Secure.
